Comparison Tool

This tool is intended to compare the values of two (or more in the future) items based on their amount-to-price ratio.

Current Features:

- Can compare 2 items
- Compare different units within the same type (kg vs g, quart vs ml)
- Initial input checking (non-zero price / amount, units measure the same thing (both mass / both volume))

Future Roadmap:

- Add CSS
- Add tests
- Compare more than 2 items
- Combine amount & price into one input
- Store previously compared items for auto-fill
- Use a separate database for items to compare

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
